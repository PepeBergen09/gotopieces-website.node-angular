      <!-- Excerpt -->
      <p class="dark-grey-text">This past weekend, GotoPiecesGames attended our local gaming convention, RegnCon XXVII for the first time.
        RegnCon is a Norwegian three day Convention that focus on role playing games, miniature and board games,
        and we were invited to playtest and show Fjordar to fellow board gamers and friends. During its´ 26 first years,
        RegnCon was held in a local school, but this year the Convention had taken a big step upwards, and moved into a
        fancy conference hotel. This was much appreciated with free popcorn, ice cream, sweet pastry and coffee that
        helped on the, at times, low blood sugar after hours of playing.

      <!-- Excerpt -->
      <p class="dark-grey-text">Choosing the right artist to create the best illustration for the game box is really important and something we have spent a lot of time on. We decided to go with the talented Tomas Duchek. <br>
        We wanted the style to remind you somewhat of the Norwegian national romantics of the 1800s with reference to Hans Gude, one of Norway´s foremost landscape painters from the 19th century.

      <!-- Excerpt -->
      <p class="dark-grey-text">One of the coolest parts of our hobby is to try new games in combination with meeting new people and sometimes also travel to new places. When we also got the chance to playtest and demo Fjordar it was an easy choice to book tickets to Birmingham. This was Tales first visit to a board game EXPO but definitely not the last! </p>

        <!-- Excerpt -->
        <p class="dark-grey-text">We have been friends for almost 20 years. Frode has been into board games for almost as
          long, and was the one who introduced us to the world of modern board games, with wooden cubes, hexes and plastic
          miniatures. After he convinced Kristine that going to SPIEL 2015 was a must, there was no turning back. One cold
          night in January while drinking beer, we decided that it would be fun to found a board game publisher! And a few
          months later, on the 10th of April, Go to Pieces Games was officially founded. </p>
