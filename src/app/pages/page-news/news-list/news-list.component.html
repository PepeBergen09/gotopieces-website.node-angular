        <!-- Excerpt -->
        <p class="dark-grey-text">One of the coolest parts of our hobby is to try new games in combination with meeting new people and sometimes also travel to new places. When we also got the chance to playtest and demo Fjordar it was an easy choice to book tickets to Birmingham. This was Tales first visit to a board game EXPO but definitely not the last! </p>

          <!-- Excerpt -->
          <p class="dark-grey-text">We have been friends for almost 20 years. Frode has been into board games for almost as long and was the one who introduced us to the world of modern board games with wooden cubes, hexes and plastic miniatures. After he convinced Kristine that going to SPIEL 2015 was a must there was no turning back. One cold night in January while drinking beer we decided that it would be fun to found a board game publisher! And a few months later, on the 10th of April, Go to Pieces Games was officially founded. </p>
